# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Mark I
This is my first version of a sentiment analysis algorithm using a twitter database and textblob.
I have uploaded two different .ipynb files 

1. BigData - Uses a dataset of 60k+ tweets that focus on Bitcoin specifically.
2. LiveData - Allows you to integrate the twitter api to collect live tweets (you have to be an approved twitter developer with consumer and access keys+secrets)

This is the first iteration of my algorithm, and I plan on tokenizing the tweets and developing either a reinforced or unsupervised ML model to better determine sentiment.

Feel free to reach out to me on Github or any social media platform (@jakeradler or @meetordy)
